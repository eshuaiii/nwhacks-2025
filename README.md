## Reimagining Disaster Response Through Real-Time Collaboration

### Our Story
Born from the devastating Los Angeles fires that tore through our communities, LifeBeacon emerged as a response to a critical observation: in the chaos of natural disasters, the lack of real-time information sharing between first responders can cost precious minutes – and lives. We witnessed brave firefighters and emergency personnel struggling to coordinate effectively while our neighborhoods burned, and we knew there had to be a better way.

### What is LifeBeacon?
Think of LifeBeacon as Life360 for first responders – but supercharged for emergency situations. It's a real-time disaster response platform that enables:
- Live location tracking of all emergency personnel
- Real-time video streaming from the field
- Instant updates on resource allocation
- Dynamic mapping of affected areas
- Seamless multi-agency coordination

### Technical Implementation

#### Real-Time Data Streaming
Our platform utilizes WebSocket technology through Socket.io to ensure instantaneous data transmission between field personnel and command centers. This enables real-time location tracking, resource status updates, and immediate communication between team members. The WebSocket implementation ensures that every team member has the most current information, critical for making split-second decisions in emergency situations.
